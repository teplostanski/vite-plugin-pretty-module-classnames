# ðŸ¤” What Problem Does This Plugin Solve?

In React with CSS modules, we're used to class names like `SomeComponent__classname_hash`. By default, Vite generates names in the format `__classname_hash`, omitting the component name, which makes debugging more difficult.

If you try to add the component name through the `generateScopedName: '[name]__[local]_[hash:base64:5]'` configuration, React will add an extra `-module` suffix, and in Vue, such configuration may lead to build errors.

This plugin solves these problems and ensures predictable, readable class naming in the format `ComponentName__classname_hash` regardless of the framework.

> [!TIP] What are generated class names and where are they visible?
>
> When you use CSS modules, the resulting class names are automatically generated by the bundler (e.g., Vite or Webpack). These names are visible:
> - in the HTML code of the page (through browser DevTools);
> - in the final CSS file;
> - when debugging in the browser as you search for the right element or style.
>
> Readable class names that include the component name help you quickly understand where a style comes from, making debugging and project maintenance easier.
