## 🤔 Why Use This?

As utilizing CSS modules in React, we're accustomed to seeing class names formatted as `SomeComponent__classname_hash`. However, with Vite, the naming convention for modular class names appears slightly different, resembling `__classname_hash` or `SomeComponent-module__classname_hash` the latter occurring if `generateScopedName: '[name]__[local]_[hash:base64:5]'` is specified in vite.config.js. This addition of `-module` post-component name can be cumbersome to work around.

Fortunately, the `vite-plugin-pretty-module-classnames` provides a solution to this issue!
